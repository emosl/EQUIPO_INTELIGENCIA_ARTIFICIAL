### **Introduction**

Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive window into brain activity by measuring electrical signals through scalp electrodes, offering valuable insights into cognitive and emotional processes. Traditional EEG analysis relies primarily on visual inspection and basic statistical methods, limiting the extraction of meaningful patterns from complex neural data. This study explores a novel approach integrating the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) with advanced Quantitative Electroencephalography (QEEG) techniques to analyze brainwave dynamics during cognitive concentration tasks. The EnKF, a robust data assimilation algorithm originally developed for meteorological applications, enhances temporal resolution and accuracy of EEG signal reconstruction while effectively handling nonlinear systems with affordable computational requirements. By examining distinct sensor configurations—winner channels, non-winner channels, and all sensors—we aimed to identify task-relevant brain regions and assess their contributions to cognitive processing, demonstrating the potential of artificial intelligence applications in neuroscience research.
